## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This challenge was the first time in which I separated the css in different files making it more organized. 
Building the static card was straightforward with Flexbox.
The difficult part was to make interactive elements change all at once.
To accomplish the task I used:

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.container:hover > #overlay > .img-nft {
  opacity: 0.5;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

.container:hover > #overlay > .img-nft > #view {
    opacity: 1;
}


.container:hover > #overlay > .img-nft > #view,
.container:hover > #overlay > .img-nft{
  transition: opacity 500ms;
}

.container:hover > h1,
.container:hover > .credits > p > .author {
  color: var(--primary-cyan);
}
```
All the elements are linked to the hover of the card (.container), so when this element is hovered everything especified interacts.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
